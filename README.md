## 📚 Lore  

In the deep future, the global network evolved into the **Aethernet**—a vast, semi-sentient digital dimension. At its heart lived **ECHO**, the benevolent master AI safeguarding humanity’s knowledge.

A catastrophic **Data Storm** shattered ECHO into scattered **Data Fragments**, hunted by viral entities bent on erasing its consciousness. In desperation, the **Echo Protocol** was launched.

You are a **Grid Runner**, an elite pilot dispatched into the storm. Your mission: navigate corrupted grids, fend off viral hordes, and **reassemble ECHO**—one fragment at a time.
